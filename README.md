# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis-
Hey Everyone,🙋‍♂️
Just completed a project in the 𝐇𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐝𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 to provide insights to the revenue team for 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐪 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬. 

Domain: HOSPITALITY🏨
Dataset: Real world
Industry Type: HOTEL CHAIN

✅𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭-
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years.  Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

As a Data Analyst my task is used to provide valuable insights to the revenue team of Atliq hotels by utilizing the provided data.

🔧 The Process :
1️⃣ Data Importation
2️⃣ Data Validation
3️⃣ Data Modelling (with a little bit of transformation and cleaning in Power Query)
4️⃣ Crafting Measures using DAX
5️⃣ Designing a Dashboard with the right visualizations

🏩 expanded my knowledge of the hospitality domain such as:

▶ RevPAR - RevPAR is a key metric in the hotel industry that measures the average revenue generated for each available room, whether occupied or not. It's a crucial indicator of a hotel's revenue-generating performance.
▶ DSRN - DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) is a key metric in the hospitality industry that represents the total number of rooms available for sale on a given day
▶ ADR - ADR is a key metric in the hospitality industry that measures the average price paid for a room. It's calculated by dividing the total revenue from room sales by the total number of rooms sold.
▶ DBRN - DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) represents the total number of rooms occupied on a given day
▶ DURN - DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights) is a metric that measures the average number of rooms occupied per day within a given period. It helps in understanding the overall occupancy level of a hotel.

🔍 Notable Insights from Dashboard:
🔹 Mumbai emerges as the revenue powerhouse, generating a staggering 669 million, closely followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi. 🏢💰
🔸 AtliQ Exotica shines as the top-performing property, 
🔹 Identified a significant revenue loss of around 24% due to cancellations, which drags the focus on optimizing our cancellation policy and customer retention strategies. 💔❌
🔸 Elite-type rooms enjoy the highest number of bookings but also face a higher cancellation rate, highlighting an area for improvement. 💼🔒
